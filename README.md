# fedora-new-install
Utility scripts for a clean fedora installation

## `new-install.go`

Run basic stuff, like update the system, disable some services like sshd, install some useful programs, remove others, lock the root account, etc...

You can also select to install programming tools for different languages like Go, C, Java and NodeJS.

The script is really simple, actually it could be entirely written in bash, but I wanted to practice my Go skills.
Because the source code is simple, you can easily modify it and adjust it to your needs.
